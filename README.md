# This repo is on creating a comic using Stable Diffusion

## Uses-Animagine XL 3.0 model and Dreambooth

## Also ,will Pick characters from 2 different color-scale anime comics

## Will enhance it, seeing if I can learn specific color palettes, keep character consistency, and keep the style in which objects are drawn

## Goal here is to create a compelling comic story combining characters across different anime cartoons.
